    <br>
    This year we are doing things a little differently....<br>
    <br>
    OWASP is pleased to invite you to our Global AppSec US Conference.  This year we will have MORE networking opportunities, a NEW track for mentorship, NEW sponsorship opportunities, AND unveiling our newest extension of the conference, Developer Day on September 26th where you can come hear the pain of others and share yours while looking for solutions!<br>
    <br>
    Join us for the newly designed OWASP Global AppSec US Conference alongside 1200+ cybersecurity experts from September 11-13 at the USMA University  in Panam치 City, Panam치. <br>
    <br>
    Immerse yourself in thought-provoking presentations by globally renowned keynote speakers, choose from our diverse array of five tracks ranging in focus from OWASP Projects to tracks aimed at your particular field of interest such as builder/developer, breaker, defender, and manager-culture. Other opportunities include exploring the exhibitor hall, participating in the Meet the Mentor Program, and fostering connections with fellow security professionals either at the event or at one of our various networking receptions.<br>
    <br>
    As an added bonus, you can level up on your education by taking advantage of one of our SEVEN hands on training options*, available for one, two, and three days from September 11-13. *<br>
